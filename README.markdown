A (not so) simple RSS feed torrent downloader


TODO:

* Build compiled executable and installer
* Add update checking
* Make sure app is working on linux
* Add balloon notification on new download
** Currently has the ability to use growl but investigate other options
* Add growl connection options
* Remove all spurious output to stdout
* Make history searchable/filterable
* Add easier ability to test regular expressions
* Add way to create a regular expression for the user
* Add labels to feeds to indentify them in history
* Testing is currently half-assed. Fix that.
* POSSIBLE: Add uTorrent integration
* BUG: The re changed check isn't working
