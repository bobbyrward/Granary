A (not so) simple RSS feed torrent downloader


TODO in order of priority:

* BUG: The re changed check isn't working
* Make history searchable/filterable
* Build compiled executable and installer
* Add easier ability to test regular expressions
* Add growl connection options
* Add way to create a regular expression for the user
* Add labels to feeds to indentify them in history
* Add update checking
* Testing is currently half-assed. Fix that.
* Make sure app is working on linux
* Add balloon notification on new download
** Currently has the ability to use growl but investigate other options
* POSSIBLE: Add uTorrent integration
